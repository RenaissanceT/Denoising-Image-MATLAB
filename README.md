# Denoising-Image-MATLAB
The objective of this project is to analyze the fourier spectrum of a noisy image and denoise (noise reduction) the image using bandstop filtering.

The quality of the original image was vague since there are numerous noise strips on the image for distraction. There are indeed some image artifacts that appear in the image. An image artifact is sometimes the result of improper operation of the imager, and other times a consequence of natural processes or properties of the human body. Thus, we need to compress the noise to improve the quality of the original image. 

The performance of the filtered image has been greatly improved and there is no noise anymore. The quality is better than the original image the filtered image is easy to perceive and the picture is bright, which means our methods, denoise the image using band-stop filtering, demonstrated effectiveness and success.
